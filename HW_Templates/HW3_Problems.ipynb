        "[The O(h^8) Romberg iintegration is going ot first start with composite trapezoid rule on [a,b] using a sequence of step sizes that half each time.  The step size is going to be calculated with h = (b-a) / n and this helps to produce the trapezoid estimates Ri,0 for i=0,1,2, etc.  Romberg integration also applies Richardson extrapolation to eliminate any errors from the error expansion involving even powers of h.  The extrapolation formula is used to produce increasingly accurate estimates along each row of the Romberg table. In order to reach O(h^8) accuracy, the method has to build the table through the third diagonal entry which would require four levels of trapezoid-rule refinement.  The final diagonal value is going to serve as the high-accuracy approximation of the definite integral.\n",

The reason for that is because the lower-rder errors were removed through extrapolation.  To reach this accuracy, the finest trapezoid refinement used 8 panels, which required the function to be evaluated at 9 points.  What this shows us is that we can achieve high accuracy with a small number of function evaluations.]"

Those nodes and weights are selected so that the method is exact for all polynomials up to degree 2n-1 which helps to make sure that it is very accurate. In fact it makes sure it is accurate even when using only a small number of evaluations.  Because Gauss quadrature is defined on interval [-1,1], any integralon [a,b] is converted to this standard interval using a change of variables.

When we increase the number of Gauss points to 3,4,5, or 6, the method becomes much more accurate becausethe method is able to check the function at more positions across the interval  Because that would use more information about the curve, the estimate becomes closer to the true value.

        "To set up the system of equations, we apply force balance at each joint of the truss using the conditions of sum of Fx and Fy are equal to zero.  Each member force contributes a horizontal and vertical component based on its angle, and the reaction forces also act in specific directions. Writing these force–balance equations at nodes 1, 2, and 3 gives us six equations with six unknown forces.  These equations can then be written in matrix form so they can be solved using linear algebra. LU decomposition solves this system by breaking the matrix into two simpler matrices so we can first use forward substitution and then back substitution to find all the unknown forces.\n",
        "\n",
        "LU decomposition has several advantages over Gauss elimination. LU decomposition is faster because the matrix is factored only once into a lower-triangular matrix L and an upper-triangular matrix U.  After this, solving the system becomes much faster because we only need forward and back substitution.  In Gauss elimination on the other hand, you must redo the entire elimination process every time you solve the system which can be slow."
