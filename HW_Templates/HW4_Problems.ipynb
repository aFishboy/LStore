Writing these balances for all four lakes creates a 4x4 linear system and therefore gives us four linear equations. Using the matrix inverse simply means we rearrange the equation Ac = b so that c = A^-1 * b.  This will give us the chloride concentration in each lake.  The results make sense physically because the concentration tends to decrease as water moves downstream and becomes more diluted.\n",

The value in the 4th row and 1st column of A^-1 tells us how sensitive Lake Havasu is to changes at Powell. Using this number, we can calculate how much Powell's loading must be reduced to bring Havasu's concentration down to the target. This makes physical sense because chloride added upstream travels through all the lakes and still impacts the final lake in the chain.\n",

A large condition number means the system is sensitive, so even small errors in the data can cause noticeable errors in the final concentrations.

This means that the reservoir system can be somewhat unstable when solved numerically, and accurate input data is important for trustworthy results."

        "Explain how the (a) graphical method (i.e., analyzing the plotted results), (b) bisection method, and (c) false position method work. Create programs to compute the critical depth using (a) graphical method, (b) bisection method, and (c) false position method. For part (b) and (c), also compute the number of iterations and the approximate error. Discuss the results by comparing the performance of the bisection and false position methods.\n",

        "For the graphical method, you plot the function f(y) over the 0.5-3m and identify the root by seeing where the curve crosses zero.  The plot shows the critical depth is around 1.5m, but this method only gives a visual estimate.  The bisection starts with two values where the function changes sign and repeatedly halves the interval and it always converges steadily. Using 0.5 and 3 as the initial guesses, the method found a critical depth of 1.506m in 8 iterations, which meets the 1% error requirement. For the false position method, it also uses a sign-change interval but finds each new point by drawing a secant line. In this problem, the method converged slowly because the function is steep on one side and flatter on the other. It hit the maximum of 10 iterations and gave a less accurate value of 2.424 m.  Bisection worked faster and more accurately because the function's shape caused false position to stall.  False position can be faster in some caases, but here it did not reduce the error quickly enough.  "

Create a program that uses the bisection method or false position to determine the $x$ value that correspond with the point of maximum deflection (hint: it may be useful to plot the above function and its derivative to visualize where the point of maximum deflection might be—this can inform your initial guesses for the bisection method). Finally, plug this $x$ value into the original function above to determine the value of the maximum deflection.

        "In order to find maximum deflection of the beam, we would first look for the point where the beam stops bending downward and begins to bend upward again.  This will happen when the slope of the deflection curve is zero, which means we take the derivative of the deflection equation and set it equal to zero.  The derivative ends up being a fourth-degree equation and we use the bisection method to find where the derivative crosses zero.  The bisection method works by starting with two x -values and then we check the sign of the derivative.  After that we repeatedly cut the interval in half until it pinpoints the exact x-location.  Once we find that value of x, we plug it back into the orginal deflection equation to get the maximum deflection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Physically, this point would represent the lowest spot on the beam where it bends the most under the triangular load. Because the load is heavier on the right side, the maximum deflection also occurs on that side of the beam.  This result matches what we saw in the orginal plots where the curve is doing to dip lower near the heavier load and the numerical root-finding gives a precise location of that minimum point."
